## Refined Hints

1. **Embedding Lookups**
   - Use `C[x]` (where `x` is a tensor of character IDs) to retrieve a batch of embeddings at once.
   - Ensure the shape matches what your MLP expects.

2. **Flattening Embeddings**
   - If your embeddings have shape `[batch_size, block_size, embed_dim]`, you can reshape or view them as `[batch_size, block_size * embed_dim]`.

3. **Defining Layers**
   - Use `torch.nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)` for fully connected layers.
   - For a non-linearity, `torch.tanh` is straightforward for small networks.

4. **Cross Entropy**
   - `F.cross_entropy(logits, targets)` handles the softmax internally.
   - Targets must be integer indices (not one-hot).

5. **Mini-Batching**
   - Use something like `torch.randint(0, X_train.shape[0], (batch_size,))` to pick random batch indices.
   - Index into `X_train` and `Y_train` using these random indices.

6. **Learning Rate Tuning**
   - Too high: loss may explode or oscillate.
   - Too low: loss decreases slowly.
   - A common technique is to start with a moderate LR, monitor loss, then reduce if progress stagnates.

7. **Overfitting vs. Underfitting**
   - If training loss << validation loss, you’re overfitting.
   - If training loss ~ validation loss but both are high, you’re underfitting (bigger network, more training steps, or different hyperparameters might help).

8. **Sampling**
   - `torch.multinomial(probabilities, num_samples=1)` can be used for sampling a single next character index from the predicted distribution.
   - Make sure your context updating logic is correct (sliding window or appending).

9. **Visualization**
   - Plot the training loss curve (and val loss curve) with `matplotlib`.
   - If embeddings are 2D, plot scatter points with character labels.

10. **Common Pitfalls**
   - Forgetting to zero out gradients each step.
   - Not using `.requires_grad_()` when you manually initialize parameters.
   - Mixing up batch dimension or shape mismatch errors.
