# DL Learn

A place for all time spent learning and building models from scratch. This is specifically focused on neural network style architectures. 

The idea to learn and revise by doing, instead of just reading theory and papers. As I build this repository out, I will implement more papers. 

Currently building
- [ ] Andrej Karpathy's NN tutorials playlist
  - [X] Neural Networks from Scratch
  - [X] Makemore
    - [X] Bigram character language model to predict the next character
    - [ ] MLP model following [Bengio et al 2003](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2000/file/728f206c2a01bf572b5940d7d9a8fa4c-Paper.pdf)
